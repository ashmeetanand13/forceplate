## Core Functions & Formulas

### 1. Statistical Analysis

**T-Test & Effect Size (Cohen's d)**
```
p_value = Independent samples t-test
Pooled SD = √[((n₁-1)×SD₁² + (n₂-1)×SD₂²) / (n₁+n₂-2)]
Effect Size = (Mean₂ - Mean₁) / Pooled SD
```

**Purpose:** Compare two sessions statistically to determine if performance changes are significant.

**Interpretation:**
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant change
- Effect Size: 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), 0.8 (large)

---

### 2. Clustering Analysis

**Method:** K-Means clustering with PCA visualization

**Features Used:**
- Max Speed
- Average Speed
- Best Acceleration (0-5m time)
- Consistency (standard deviation)
- Load Retention (speed maintained under load)

**Formula for Retention:**
```
Retention (%) = (Heavy Load Speed / Light Load Speed) × 100
```

**Purpose:** Groups athletes with similar performance profiles for targeted training and identifying training partners.

---

### 3. Similarity Matching

**Distance Formula (Normalized Euclidean):**
```
Distance = √[Σ(target - athlete)²] / √(number of metrics)
Similarity = 100 / (1 + Distance)
```

**Metrics Compared:**
- Max Speed
- Average Speed
- Best 0-5m Time

**Result:** Similarity score 0-100 (higher = more similar)

**Purpose:** Find athletes with similar performance profiles for paired training.

---

### 4. Optimal Power Zone Analysis

**Power Formula (Horizontal Power):**
```
Power = (Athlete Weight + Load) × Average Acceleration × Average Speed
Units: kg × m/s² × m/s = Watts
```

**Training Zones:**
- **Speed Zone:** Lightest 33% of loads OR up to 70% of optimal load
  - Focus: Maximum velocity development
  - Exercises: Overspeed training, flying sprints, light sled

- **Power Zone:** ±20% around optimal load (clamped to tested range)
  - Focus: Maximum power output
  - Exercises: Resisted sprints, explosive starts

- **Strength Zone:** 130% of optimal to maximum tested
  - Focus: Force production
  - Exercises: Heavy sled pushes, hill sprints

**Safety:** All zones are capped within tested load ranges to prevent invalid recommendations.

---

### 5. Acceleration Dominance Profile

**Velocity-Acceleration Ratio:**
```
Ratio = Max Speed (m/s) / Best 0-5m Time (s)
```

**Classification:**
- Ratio > 8.5: Top Speed Dominant (high max speed, slower acceleration)
- Ratio 7.0-8.5: Balanced profile
- Ratio < 7.0: Acceleration Dominant (explosive start, lower top speed)

**Example:**
- Elite sprinter: 10.0 m/s ÷ 1.0s = 10.0 (Speed Dominant)
- Soccer player: 8.0 m/s ÷ 1.05s = 7.6 (Balanced)

**Purpose:** Identifies athlete's strength to guide training focus.

---

### 6. Asymmetry Analysis

**Asymmetry Percentage:**
```
Asymmetry (%) = |Left - Right| / Max(Left, Right) × 100
```

**Risk Levels:**
- Low Risk: < 5% asymmetry
- Moderate Risk: 5-10% asymmetry
- High Risk: > 10% asymmetry

**Purpose:** Identify left/right imbalances that may increase injury risk. High asymmetries require corrective exercises and unilateral training.

---

### 7. Eccentric Strength Analysis

**Eccentric:Concentric Ratio:**
```
Ratio = Average Eccentric Load / Average Concentric Load
```

**Capacity Assessment:**
- Excellent: Ratio > 1.4 (handles 40%+ more eccentric)
- Good: Ratio 1.2-1.4 (typical 20-40% more)
- Developing: Ratio 1.0-1.2
- Needs Development: Ratio < 1.0

**Quality Check:** Requires minimum 5 sessions with eccentric data.

**Purpose:** Eccentric strength is critical for deceleration, change of direction, and injury prevention in soccer.

---

### 8. Power Endurance

**Sprint Decrement:**
```
Decrement (%) = [(First 3 Sprints Avg - Last 3 Sprints Avg) / First 3 Sprints Avg] × 100
```

**Scoring:**
- Excellent: < 3% decrement
- Good: 3-5% decrement
- Moderate: 5-8% decrement
- Poor: > 8% decrement

**Purpose:** Measures ability to maintain power output throughout a session. Important for repeated sprint sports like soccer.

---

### 9. Injury Risk Assessment

**Multi-Factor Scoring System (Total: 100 points)**

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Asymmetry (35 points max)**
   - High asymmetry (>10%): +35 points
   - Moderate asymmetry (5-10%): +20 points

2. **Recent Performance Drop (35 points max)**
   - Compares last 3 sessions vs previous 3 sessions
   - Drop > 5%: +35 points

3. **High Variability (30 points max)**
   - Coefficient of Variation > 10%: +30 points

**Overall Risk:**
- Low Risk (0-24): Continue current program
- Moderate Risk (25-49): Monitor closely, consider lighter loads
- High Risk (50+): Reduce training load, corrective exercises

**Purpose:** Comprehensive injury risk screening combining multiple performance indicators.

---

### 10. Performance Prediction (EWMA)

**Exponential Weighted Moving Average:**
```
EWMA[i] = α × Speed[i] + (1-α) × EWMA[i-1]
Where α = 0.3 (30% weight to recent sessions)
```

**Trend Calculation:**
- Uses linear regression on last 5 EWMA points
- Calculates trend rate (m/s per day)

**Prediction with Dampening:**
```
Raw Prediction = Current Speed + (Trend Rate × Days Ahead)
Dampening Factor = 1.0 - (Days Ahead / 100)
Damped Prediction = Current + (Raw - Current) × Dampening Factor
```

**Caps:** Predictions limited to ±5% from current max speed

**Trend Classification:**
- Improving: Trend > +0.002 m/s/day (+0.06 m/s/month)
- Declining: Trend < -0.002 m/s/day (-0.06 m/s/month)
- Stable: Between -0.002 and +0.002 m/s/day

**Purpose:** Provides realistic performance predictions that account for:
- Recent data weighted more heavily
- Natural adaptation curves (dampening)
- Biological limits (capping)

## Best Practices for Use

### Data Quality
- Ensure consistent date formatting in CSV files
- Include athlete weight data for accurate power calculations
- Tag sprints with Left/Right side for asymmetry analysis
- Record eccentric loads when applicable

### Analysis Recommendations
- **Minimum sessions:** 3-5 sessions for reliable trends
- **Baseline periods:** Use 2-4 week windows for team trends
- **Injury risk:** Check weekly for high-risk athletes
- **Training zones:** Retest every 4-6 weeks as athletes adapt

### Interpretation Guidelines
- Small improvements (1-2%) may not be statistically significant
- Consistency (low CV%) is as important as peak performance
- Asymmetries > 10% require immediate attention
- Declining trends over 2+ weeks warrant program review
