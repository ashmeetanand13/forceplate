- Performance heatmaps

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/force-plate-analysis.git
cd force-plate-analysis
```

2. **Install required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. **Open in browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìä Data Requirements

Your CSV file should contain the following columns:
- `ATHLETE_NAME`: Athlete identifiers
- `TARGET_VARIABLE`: Metric names (e.g., JUMP_HEIGHT, PEAK_POWER)
- `RESULT`: Measurement values
- `TEST_DATE`: Date of testing
- `LIMB`: Should include 'Trial' for bilateral measurements
- `TEST_TYPE` or `JUMP_TYPE`: Type of jump performed (optional)

### Sample Data Format
```csv
ATHLETE_NAME,TARGET_VARIABLE,RESULT,TEST_DATE,LIMB,TEST_TYPE
John Doe,JUMP_HEIGHT,45.2,2023-01-15,Trial,CMJ
John Doe,PEAK_POWER,3500,2023-01-15,Trial,CMJ
...
```

## üéØ How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Data
1. Click on "Choose your force plate CSV file" in the sidebar
2. Wait for the file to upload and process
3. Review the data overview statistics

### Step 2: Configure Analysis
1. **Select Jump Type**: Choose which jump type to analyze
2. **Select Athletes**: Pick 2-15 athletes for comparison
3. **Adjust Metrics**: Set number of metrics (10-50)
